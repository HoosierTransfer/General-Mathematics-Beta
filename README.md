Unblocker I made for school. Has authentication with keys so admins cant access it.

The code for this is absolute shit btw.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/HoosierTransfer/unblocker.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd unblocker
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```
